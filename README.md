# Welcome to TinyApp!

TinyApp is a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs, much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do. The purpose of a URL shortener is to make a URL more manageable. For websites like Twitter, where you are limited by the number of characters, a link such as: https://tiny.app/u/b2xVn2 is a lot better than https://web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/projects/tiny-app. This also makes a URL more shareable and even allows customisation. 

**_BEWARE:_  This library was published for learning purposes. It is  _not_  intended for use in production-grade software.**
